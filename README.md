# PY REDIS CLI

A trashy name for a not-so-trashy utility.<br>
I personally would like to call it <br>
#### REDIS-SHELL

### Features
I only created this to support encryption in transit with cluster mode enabled. <br>
Not a lot of the commands are properly supported as of now<br>
Some of the command tested: <br>
	*	SET
	*	GET
	*	MONITOR
	*	DEL
	*	SUBSCRIBE ( WIP )

You can test some more commands and let me know if there are any issue.
How to repro would help in a long way in troubleshooting and bugfix


	Contributions are welcome !
	Suggestions are even more !

### How to install

Working on it .... XD


### Why not add SSL in existing redis-cli code

If you can, you should :)
I cannot, not good with C ( not good with python either but yeah! well this shit works so cut some slack here )
